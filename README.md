## High School AI - Help Blind Read

This a toy project to explain to high school students how to use AI to help blind people recognize texts in a natural scene. Here, the images captured at the Fudan campus were used to train an OCR (object character recognition) model to recognize the places in the Fudan University Handan campus. The code is adapted from an existing Github Repo for educational purposes.

The course project can be found at: http://highschool.opentai.org/.
